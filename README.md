# password-generator

Here is a step-by-step explanation  of the  password generator program :

->The code imports the random module. This module is used to generate random numbers and characters.
->The code then defines three lists: letters, numbers, and symbols. These lists contain the characters that can be used in the password.
->The code then prompts the user to enter the number of letters, numbers, and symbols they want in their password.
->The code then creates an empty list to store the password characters.
->For each letter, number, and symbol that the user requested, the code randomly selects a character from the corresponding list and adds it to the password list.
->The code then shuffles the password list. This makes the password more difficult to guess because the characters are not in a predictable order.
->The code then creates a string from the password list and prints it to the console.
